# Back-End Engineer Technical Test Project

These is a technical test for CodeRockr Back-End Engineer.

## Considerations

### About the used technology (Why i used Laravel/PHP and Jest/Node.JS for tests)

In a few words: I care about the code maintenance. 
This is not a very complex project. Just it. And by another way
LAMP is the most common web setup i ever seen and this makes easy to found
someone to work with this project.

#### Laravel/PHP

Laravel and PHP is a very solid technology, it's easy to found someone to
maintain the source code. If you are thinking about PHP are slower, you just
make it wrong. The right way to implement the hard work/complex proccess
is to implement microservices using a compiled language with RPC like interface.

#### Jest/Node.JS

I used Jest/Node.JS to make easy for the Front-End make changes on the API.
If the Front-End needs something new, he can write the endpoints and can 
send it to the Back-End to develop as fast as we can.

#### MySQL

Easy to setup, any Laravel coder can handle this easily with 
Eloquent/Migrations/Seeds/Fakes and PHPMyAdmin.

## Development roadmap

1. First, we need to setup our development stack. I'll start 
setting up VS Code Devcontainer for an easy and shared 
(shared between collaborator's) development setup.

2. Setup a REST API Tests, for TDD. I'll use Jest/Node.JS to
make cross-side API Development with the Front-End Engineer.

3. Setup Laravel 9 and start coding.
